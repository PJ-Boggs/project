# Release Sheet Table Automation

EGM722: Programming for GIS and Remote Sensing at Ulster University

## 1. Background:

As a principal contractor of telecommunications, Viberoptix Ltd are responsible for the design and build 
of full-fibre networks across Great Britain. One of the final steps in the design process for any area, is 
to provide a Release Sheet. This document comprises of a list of property addresses, which have been planned 
to, and subsequent information regarding the specific equipment and network route from which each premise is 
to be supplied.

The current, inefficient production time of Release Sheets have inhibited the overall design process. 

The aim of this project is to produce a script which will auto-generate a Release Sheet, thereby removing 
the repetitive task of doing so manually, cutting down time and cost requirements for each new area. Meanwhile, 
producing and documenting the script in a way which provides a basis for future collaboration throughout the design 
department, in the use and development of the script.
